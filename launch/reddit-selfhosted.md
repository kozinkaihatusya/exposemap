# I built an open-source exposure mapper for self-hosted Docker Compose services

GitHub: https://github.com/kozinkaihatusya/exposemap

I built ExposeMap because I kept seeing the same problem in self-hosted stacks: after a few Compose files, reverse proxies, admin tools, databases, VPNs, and experiments, it becomes hard to quickly answer what is exposed and how.

ExposeMap is a small open-source CLI that scans a `docker-compose.yml` file and classifies services as:

- internal
- localhost-only
- directly exposed
- reverse-proxy exposed
- unknown

It generates a Markdown report with a summary table, high-risk findings, service details, and a Mermaid diagram.

It can run locally with Node.js or Docker:

```bash
docker build -t exposemap .
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/scan exposemap scan /scan/docker-compose.yml --format markdown
```

Important caveat: it does not perform real network scans and does not prove internet exposure. It is a read-only Compose configuration review tool. It does not connect to containers or send Compose files anywhere.

The MVP checks common port mappings, localhost-only bindings, broad/public bindings, Traefik labels, likely reverse proxy services, and risky directly exposed ports like Postgres, Redis, MySQL, MongoDB, Elasticsearch, and common admin panels.

I would appreciate feedback, edge cases, and sanitized Compose examples. If you find it useful, a GitHub star would help other self-hosters find it.
