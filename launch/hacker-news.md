# Show HN: ExposeMap - open-source exposure mapper for Docker Compose services

GitHub: https://github.com/kaibuild/exposemap

I built ExposeMap, a small open-source CLI for self-hosters who run services with Docker Compose.

It scans a `docker-compose.yml` file and classifies services as:

- internal
- localhost-only
- directly exposed
- reverse-proxy exposed
- unknown

It also generates a Markdown report and a Mermaid diagram so you can review the likely exposure paths in a Compose stack.

The goal is not to prove real internet exposure. It does not perform network scans, connect to containers, or send files anywhere. It is a local configuration review tool based on Compose heuristics.

The MVP currently handles common port mappings, localhost bindings, Traefik-style labels, likely reverse proxy services, and risky directly exposed database/admin ports.

Longer term, I am also collecting interest for scheduled checks, history, diffs, and alerts, but the current project is just the free local CLI.

Feedback, edge cases, and sanitized Compose examples are welcome.
